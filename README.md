While doing this project, I learned about making layouts using CSS Flexbox and I also figured out about how height property works in CSS (while I encountered an error).

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31728022/why-is-percentage-height-not-working-on-my-div) - This article helped me a lot to figure out how css height works with % while I encountered an error in giving height (using %) to one of the div's.
